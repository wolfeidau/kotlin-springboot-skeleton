# kotlin-springboot-skeleton

This is a simple skeleton project for kotlin + jersey + springboot, it was created to demonstrate these working together and act as a starting point for microservices.

# why kotlin?

This really comes down to a few things:

1. Similar to Java without the boilerplate.
2. Not some massive mental leap as other options.
3. Very similar to other modern languages, such as swift and typescript.
